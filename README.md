## About
For my final CS50 project, I decided to build upon a python program that I had already started in the past. It was a code for a hotel, which offered single and double rooms. This program allows for customers to book rooms and hotel services and the booking is saved and then a receipt is printed out at the end of the program.



To run the program on CS50 ide, it is : python `program.py` otherwise its just 'program.py'.
